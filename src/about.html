<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>Flip through puzzles with the <b>Next</b> and <b>Prev</b> buttons or
the <b>N</b> and <b>P</b> keys.  You can work on the puzzles in any
order and come back to any puzzle later.

<p>To fill in a puzzle, click on a number on the right and then click
on any square to pencil in that number.  The rules of Sudoku are that
every digit 1-9 must appear once in each row, column, and 3x3 block.

<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>You can also use the keyboard.  Point at a square or use arrow
<b>&larr;</b> <b>&uarr;</b> <b>&darr;</b> <b>&rarr;</b> keys
to move the dotted blue rectangle, and then type a digit <b>1</b> -
<b>9</b> to fill it in.
Typing multiple numbers in a square will mark all those numbers, but
a double-tapped number will clear all marks and write the number as
the answer.  Use the <b>space</b> or <b>0</b> key to clear the
selected square again.

<p>The comma <b>,</b> key brings up a menu that lets you mark multiple
numbers.  With the menu showing, the <b>H</b> key lets you highlight
marked numbers in yellow.  The <b>M</b> key automatically marks numbers
that are not in direct conflict in the row, column, or block, and
the <b>Marks</b> button fills these in for every square.

<h2>Getting Hints</h2>

<p>Click a color on the left to reveal squares that are
that level of difficulty: violet squares are the easiest, and red
squares are the hardest.  Click the <b>Color</b> button to reveal
all colors.

<p>Hold down the <b>Hint</b> button to get a specific hint.  Red squares
point out any mistakes.  Blue squares will be places that constrain the
puzzle in some way, and green squares will be locations where a number
can be filled in, or where the possibilities can be narrowed down.

<p>If you are still stuck, you can try a more explicit hint by holding
down <b>ctrl</b> while clicking the <b>Hint</b> button.  Sometimes
the strategies shown will be very subtle: learn to recognize
<a target=_blank href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Naked_Candidates">naked pairs</a>
and <a target=_blank href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Intersection_Removal">intersections</a>,
and see if you can find the
<a target=_blank href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Hidden_Candidates">hidden pairs
or triples</a> or recognize an
<a target=_blank href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/X_Wing_Strategy">x-wing</a>,
<a target=_blank href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Y_Wing_Strategy">y-wing</a> or
<a target=_blank href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sword_Fish_Strategy">swordfish</a>.

<h2>Checking and Fixing Mistakes</h2>

<p>The <b>Check</b> button can be used to quickly check if you
have penciled in any mistakes or contradictory squares without
revealing what the mistakes are.

<p>Holding <b>ctrl</b> while clicking <b>Check</b> will show
you the position of a mistake.

<p>When you discover a mistake, you can use the browser's "back" button
to undo as many moves as you need to.

<h2>The Timer</h2>

<p>The game will keep track of the amount of time it has taken you to
solve a puzzle.  Press the <b>Timer</b> button to display the elapsed
time and hint counter.

<p>If you walk away from a puzzle and don't want all the idle time
counted against you, don't worry: press the "Refresh" button in your
browser and the timer will go back to the time you made your last move.
Similarly, if you save a game, the time saved will be the time of the
last move made.

<h2>Saving and Sharing Puzzles</a>

<p>Puzzles can also be saved and loaded using the <b>File</b> button.
Saved games are identified by rating, date, and progress, or you can rename
them yourself.

<p>If you discover a gem of a game that you would like to share, the
<b>Save as Url</b> link will create a short URL for your current
puzzle that can be emailed.  Any markup and colors you put on the
game will be saved along with the URL, so you can share a particularly
clever sudoku step with other puzzlers.

<h2>Entering Your Own Puzzles</h2>

<p>If you right-click or hold down <b>ctrl</b> while clicking a square,
you can change the puzzle at any time.  Holding <b>ctrl</b> while
clicking <b>Clear</b> will clear the entire puzzle, and you can enter
a new puzzle using the keyboard or mouse.  Note that some numbers cannot
be entered because the hintpad will not let you enter a puzzle that has
no solution.

<p>As soon as you have entered a puzzle with a unique solution, a
difficulty rating will be shown and the keyboard will switch back to
game mode.

<h2>Mathematically Minimal Puzzles</h2>

<p>Usually the puzzles found in Heidi's Infinite Sudoku Pad will have
25-30 hints.  Naturally, if there are fewer hints, you enjoy a
slightly longer game.

<p>The smallest number of hints that can be given on a solvable Suduoku
game is believed to be 17, and Gordon Royle maintains a database of all
17-hint puzzles that have been discovered so far.  If you hold
<b>ctrl</b> while clicking <b>File</b>, one of these 17-hint
puzzles will be loaded from the internet.

<h2>Difficulty Ratings</h3>

<p>Sudoku puzzles are rated on a 24-level scale from "Beginner" (the easiest)
to "Counfounding" (the hardest).  The whole scale:

<center><table><tr><td>
1: Beginner<br>
2: Easy<br>
3: Simple<br>
4: Basic<br>
5: Moderate<br>
6: Tricky<br>
</td><td>
7: Clever<br>
8: Puzzling<br>
9: Subtle<br>
10: Difficult<br>
11: Knotty<br>
12: Thorny<br>
</td><td>
13: Baffling<br>
14: Intricate<br>
15: Perplexing<br>
16: Obscure<br>
17: Labyrinthine<br>
18: Obstinate<br>
</td><td>
19: Abstruse<br>
20: Vexing<br>
21: Enigmatic<br>
22: Formidable<br>
23: Diabolical<br>
24: Confounding<br>
</td></tr></table>
</center>

<p>Puzzles that can be solved by just avoiding direct conflicts
are "Basic" or easier, depending on how easy it is to see the
constraints.  "Subtle" puzzles require one or two clever deductions.
And it gets more difficult from there: "Confounding" puzzles
involve untangling a mass of complex clues.
