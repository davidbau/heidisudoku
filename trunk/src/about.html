<h2>Heidi's Helpful Hints</h2>

<p>Heidi's Sudoku is your puzzling companion, always ready
with a bit of guidance or a hint if you get stuck.  You can
get explicit hints, or you can get a colored map showing where
something clever is worth mulling over.

<p>The hintpad is excellent way to learn to solve sudoku
quickly, and it can also help you learn more advanced techniques.

<h2>Controls</h2>

<p>Click on a number on the right and then click on any square to
pencil in that number.

<p>Keyboard controls also work: use arrow keys to move the dotted blue
rectangle, and use numbers to fill in numbers.  Typing multiple numbers
in a square will mark all those numbers, but a double-tapped number
will clear all marks and just write the number as the answer.  Space
or delete to clear the selected square.

<p>Click outside the board to deselect the number.  When a square
is clicked without any selected number, you get a menu that lets
you mark off multiple numbers.  The comma key also brings up
this menu; press the escape key or move the mouse away to dismiss it.

<p>Clicking on a color to the left will show you which squares are
that level of difficulty: purple squares are the easiest, and red
squares are the hardest.

<h2>Difficulty Ratings</h3>

<p>Good puzzles are rated on a 24-level scale from "Beginner" (the easiest)
to "Counfounding" (the hardest).  The whole scale:

<center><table><tr><td>
1: Beginner<br>
2: Easy<br>
3: Simple<br>
4: Basic<br>
5: Moderate<br>
6: Tricky<br>
</td><td>
7: Clever<br>
8: Puzzling<br>
9: Subtle<br>
10: Difficult<br>
11: Knotty<br>
12: Thorny<br>
</td><td>
13: Baffling<br>
14: Intricate<br>
15: Perplexing<br>
16: Obscure<br>
17: Labyrinthine<br>
18: Obstinate<br>
</td><td>
19: Abstruse<br>
20: Vexing<br>
21: Enigmatic<br>
22: Formidable<br>
23: Diabolical<br>
24: Confounding<br>
</td></tr></table>
</center>

<p>Puzzles that can be solved by just avoiding direct conflicts
are "Basic" or easier, depending on how easy it is to see the
constraints.  "Subtle" puzzles require one or two clever deductions.
And it gets more difficult from there: "Confounding" puzzles
involve untangling a mass of complex clues.

<p>Generated puzzles are always created at one of these levels, but
there are two other ratings that can be given to a puzzle entered manually.
Puzzles rated "Impossible" have a solution, but they are no fun because
they require some lucky guessing to solve.  Puzzles rated "Unsolvable"
are incorrect puzzles that have either no complete solution or
multiple different solutions.

<h2>Visualizing Difficulty</h2>

<p>When speeding through games or when choosing puzzles to play, it can
be helpful to visualize the difficulty of a puzzle.

<p>Squares of a given difficulty can be revealed by clicking on one
of the colored buttons.  That will show every cell with the
color that indicates the difficulty of solving that square.

<p>Squares colored violet are the easiest; then blue, green, yellow,
and orange are progressively harder.  Red squares are the hardest.

<h2>Getting Hints</h2>

<p>To get a specific hint, hold down the <b>Hint</b> button.  Red squares point
out any mistakes.  Blue squares will be places that constrain the puzzle
in some way, and green squares will be locations where a number can be
filled in, or where the possibilities can be narrowed down.

<p>If you are still stuck, you can try a more explicit hint by holding
down <b>ctrl</b> while clicking the <b>Hint</b> button.  Sometimes
the strategies shown will be very subtle: learn to recognize
<a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Naked_Candidates">naked pairs</a>
and <a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Intersection_Removal">intersections</a>,
and see if you can find the
<a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Hidden_Candidates">hidden pairs
or triples</a> or recognize an
<a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/X_Wing_Strategy">x-wing</a>,
<a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Y_Wing_Strategy">y-wing</a> or
<a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sword_Fish_Strategy">swordfish</a>.

<h2>Checking and Fixing Mistakes</h2>

<p>The <b>Check</b> button can be used to quickly check if you
have penciled in any mistakes or contradictory squares without
revealing what the mistakes are.

<p>Holding <b>ctrl</b> while clicking <b>Check</b> will show
you the position of a mistake.

<p>When you discover a mistake, you can use the browser's "back" button
to undo as many moves as you need to.

<h2>Penciling in Candidates</h2>

<p>Eventually, you may need to slow down to carefully consider all
the candidates at a square.  You can click on more than one number to
pencil in all the candidates.  When you have figured out a number,
you can use a double-click to clear the other candidates.

<p>Normally if you choose just one candidate, it will be shown as
your answer, but if you really want to just pencil in a little
number note, you can click on the
<img style="margin:-1px" src="pencil.png" alt="pencil"> icon.
Click again to make a
<img style="margin:-1px" src="highlighter.png" alt="highligher">
that lets you highlight specific numbers.

<h2>Advanced Markup</h2>

<p>You can also use the keyboard to enter candidates.  Type numbers
to write candidates, delete or space to clear, and arrows or mouse to
move.  If you double-tap a number, it will write that number and
clear other candidates.

<p>To color a square, use the keys <b>R</b> <b>O</b> <b>Y</b> <b>G</b>
<b>B</b> <b>V</b>, or <b>W</b> to return the color to white.

<p>Candidates everywhere on the board can be automatically eliminated
based on your answers so far using the <b>Marks</b>
button.  To erase all pencilmarks and colors on the entire board, hold down
<b>ctrl</b> while clicking <b>Marks</b>.

<h2>The Timer</h2>

<p>The game will keep track of the amount of time it has taken you to
solve a puzzle.  Press the <b>Timer</b> button to reveal the elapsed
time.

<p>If you walk away from a puzzle and don't want all the idle time
counted against you, don't worry: press the "Refresh" button in your
browser and the timer will go back to the time you made your last move.
Similarly, if you save a game, the time saved will be the time of the
last move made.

<h2>Mathematically Minimal Puzzles</h2>

<p>If you click <b>New Puzzle</b>, a new puzzle with a random level of
difficulty will be randomly generated.  Usually the puzzle will have
25-30 hints.  Naturally, if there are fewer hints, you enjoy a
slightly longer game.

<p>The smallest number of hints that can be given on a solvable Suduoku
game is believed to be 17, and Gordon Royle maintains a database of all
17-hint puzzles that have been discovered so far.  If you hold
<b>ctrl</b> while clicking <b>New Puzzle</b>, one of these 17-hint
puzzles will be loaded from the internet.

<h2>Saving and Sharing Puzzles</a>

<p>Puzzles can also be saved and loaded using the <b>File</b> button.
Saved games are identified by rating, date, and progress, or you can rename
them yourself.

<p>If you discover a gem of a game that you would like to share, the
<b>Save as Url</b> link will create a short URL for your current
puzzle that can be emailed.  Any markup and colors you put on the
game will be saved along with the URL, so you can share a particularly
clever sudoku step with other puzzlers.

<h2>Editing Puzzles</h2>

<p>If you right-click or hold down <b>ctrl</b> while clicking a square,
you can change the puzzle at any time.  Holding <b>ctrl</b> while
clicking <b>Clear</b> will clear the entire puzzle, and you can enter
a new puzzle using the keyboard or mouse.  Note that some numbers cannot
be entered because the hintpad will not let you enter a puzzle that has
no solution.

<p>As soon as you have entered a puzzle with a unique solution, a
difficulty rating will be shown and the keyboard will switch back to
game mode.
