<h2>Heidi's Helpful Hints</h2>

<p>This Sudoku workpad is inspired by Heidi's favorite
way to solve Sudoku: instead of starting by eliminating candidates one
square at a time, she loves to speed along looking for digits that can only
be placed in one location because they are blocked by the same digit
in various rows, columns, or blocks.

<p>Solving sudoku puzzles by scanning the board for forced single positions
is dynamic and fun.

<h2>Difficulty Ratings</h3>

<p>Good puzzles are rated on a 21-level scale from "Beginner" (the easiest)
to "Counfounding" (the hardest).

<p>Puzzles rated "Impossible" are solvable, but the solution
may be impossible for a person to find without some lucky guessing.

<p>Puzzles rated "Unsolvable" have no unique solution: an unsolvable
puzzle has either no complete solution or multiple different solutions.

<h2>Getting Hints</h2>

<p>To get a hint, hold down the <b>Hint</b> button.  Red squares point
out any mistakes.  Blue squares will be places that constrain the puzzle
in some way, and green squares will be locations where a number can be
filled in, or where the possibilities can be narrowed down.

<p>If you are still stuck, you can try a more explicit hint by holding
down <b>ctrl</b> while clicking the <b>Hint</b> button.  Sometimes
the strategies shown will be very subtle: learn to recognize
<a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Naked_Candidates">naked pairs</a>
and <a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Intersection_Removal">pointing
pairs</a>, and see if you can find the
<a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Hidden_Candidates">hidden pairs
or triples</a> or recognize an
<a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/X_Wing_Strategy">x-wing</a> or
<a href="http://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sword_Fish_Strategy">swordfish</a>.

<h2>Checking and Fixing Mistakes</h2>

<p>The <b>Check</b> button can be used to quickly check if you
have penciled in any self-contradictory squares without revealing
other hints.  Holding <b>ctrl</b> while clicking <b>Check</b> will
also reveal harder-to-discover errors by comparing your work to the
correct final solution.

<p>When you discover a mistake, you can use the browser's "back" button
to undo as many moves as you need to.

<h2>Penciling in Candidates</h2>

<p>Eventually, you may need to slow down to carefully consider all
the candidates at a square.  You can click on more than one number to
pencil in all the candidates.  When you have figured out a number,
you can use a double-click to clear the other candidates.

<p>Normally if you choose just one candidate, it will be shown as
your answer, but if you really want to just pencil in a little
number note, you can click on the
<img style="margin:-1px" src="pencil.png" alt="pencil"> icon.
Click again to make a
<img style="margin:-1px" src="highlighter.png" alt="highligher">
that lets you highlight specific numbers.

<p>Candidates everywhere on the board can be automatically eliminated
based on your answers so far using the <b>Marks</b>
button.  To erase all pencilmarks on the entire board, hold down
<b>ctrl</b> while clicking <b>Marks</b>.

<h2>Loading Puzzles</h2>

<p>To enter your own puzzle, hold down <b>ctrl</b> while clicking each
square.  If you hold down <b>ctrl</b> while clicking <b>Clear</b>, the
entire puzzle will be cleared.  Notice that the hintpad will not let
you enter a puzzle that has no solution.

<p>If you click <b>New Puzzle</b>, a new puzzle with a random level of
difficulty will be randomly generated.

<p>Puzzles can also be saved and loaded using the <b>File</b> button.

<h2>The Timer</h2>

<p>The game will keep track of the amount of time it has taken you to
solve a puzzle.  Press the <b>Timer</b> button to reveal the elapsed
time.

<p>If you walk away from a puzzle and don't want all the idle time
counted against you, don't worry: press the "Refresh" button in your
browser and the timer will go back to the time you made your last move.
Similarly, if you save a game, the time saved will be the time of the
last move made.
